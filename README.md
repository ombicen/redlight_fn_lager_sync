# Redlight Fortnox Warehouse sync for wordpress
This proof of concept was created for the Redlight fortnox integration since I experience great trouble with the regular functionality with timeouts etc.

This code makes a smarter approach, spliting the products in chunks and lets the client(browser) to handle sync so the server won't be pressured and no server configurations will be needed.
